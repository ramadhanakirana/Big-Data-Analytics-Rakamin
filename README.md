# Rakamin Academy x Kimia Farma: Big Data Analytics 
🛠️ Tools: MySQL and Google Data Studio <br>
📑 Dataset and more information: [here](https://www.rakamin.com/virtual-internship-experience/kimiafarma-big-data-analytics-virtual-internship-program)

## 🔍 Objectives
1. Create a datamart design (consists of base table and aggregate table).
2. Create data visualization.

## 🙌 Results
### 🔄️ Entity Relationship Diagram
From the existing dataset, it consists of customer (pelanggan), goods (barang), and sales (penjualan) tables. From these three tables, a relationship (Entitty Relationship Diagram a.k.a ERD) can be formed, as shown in Figure 1. <br>

### 🪄 Create a datamart design
  A base table is a fundamental or primary table that stores raw or detailed data in a relational database. It typically represents entities or objects in the real world and contains granular information at the most detailed level. Base tables store individual records, and each row in the table represents a single data entry with specific attributes. The base table from this project is shown in Figure 2. <br>

  An aggregate table, on the other hand, is a summarized or derived table that contains precomputed results of certain operations on the base table. The purpose of an aggregate table is to improve query performance and reduce the need for complex calculations during query execution. The aggregate table from this project is shown in Figure 3. <br>
